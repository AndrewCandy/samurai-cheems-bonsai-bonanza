        pot.
        tree_lines: A list of all pymunk line objects that make up the bonsai
        tree leaf walls currently in the physics space.
        wall_lines: A list of all pymunk line objects that make up the border
        of the physics space.
        pips: A list of pymunk static circle objects for all pegs currently in
        the physics space.
        setup: An instance of the LevelSetup class that contains position
        information for game elements in each level and stage.
        ball_radius: An int representing the radius of the ball.
        balls: A list containing all dynamic circle objects currently in the
        physics space.
        current_ball_type: An int representing which type of ball is currently
        in use for scoring purposes.
        space: The 2d pymunk physics environment where all our physics objects
        exist and our simulation occurs.

    Private Attributes:
        _scores: The total score of each ball type. Saved as a list of three
        integers.
