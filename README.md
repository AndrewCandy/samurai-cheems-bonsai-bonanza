    - install by running: `pip install pygame`
- Pymunk - a physics engine used to simulate the physics of the falling objects
    - install by running: `pip install pymunk`
- Pytest - a helpful unit testing program
    - install by running: `pip install -U pytest`

### Required libraries that are default libraries
- abc - a library allowing for easy creation of abstract base classes
- math - a library used to access mathematical functions as defined by the C standard
- random - a library to generate pseudo random values

## How to run the game

The game can be run by running the python file game.py this file has the main() method which calls all other files and functions to properly run a version of the game.
